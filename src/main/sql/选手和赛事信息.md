在一场赛事中，选手经过分组后参加比赛，有以下表结构， `players` 玩家表

```
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| player_id   | int   |
| group_id    | int   |
+-------------+-------+
player_id是此表的主键。
该表包含选手id以及所在的组别
```

`matches` 赛事表

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| first_player  | int     |
| second_player | int     | 
| first_score   | int     |
| second_score  | int     |
| group_id      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id 是此表的主键。
该表包含一场比赛的比赛id，参与比赛的第一位选手和第二位选手，第一位选手的分数和第二位选手的分数以及两位选手所处的组别。
```

表的示例如下：

`players` 表:

```
+-----------+------------+
| player_id | group_id   |
+-----------+------------+
| 15        | 1          |
| 25        | 1          |
| 30        | 1          |
| 45        | 1          |
| 10        | 2          |
| 35        | 2          |
| 50        | 2          |
| 20        | 3          |
| 40        | 3          |
+-----------+------------+
```

`matches` 表:

```
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+----------+
| match_id   | first_player | second_player | first_score | second_score | group_id |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+----------+
| 1          | 15           | 45            | 3           | 0            | 1        |

| 3          | 30           | 15            | 2           | 0            | 1        |
| 4          | 40           | 20            | 5           | 2            | 3        |
| 5          | 35           | 50            | 1           | 1            | 2        |

```

1. 编写一个sql语句，查询各组进行的比赛场次，结果返回组号group_id及各组的场次数match_num。

    ```sql
    select group_id, count(*) as match_num from matches group by(group_id);
    ```

2. 编写一个sql语句，查询分差最大的一场比赛，若分差相同，选择编号match_id较小的比赛，结果返回比赛编号match_id和分差sub（大于0）。

    ```sql
    select match_id, (first_score-second_score) as sub from matches
    union
    select match_id, (second_score-first_score) as sub from matches
    group by(match_id)
    order by sub desc, match_id asc
    limit 1;
    
    select match_id, abs(first_score-second_score) as sub from matches
    order by sub desc, match_id asc
    limit 1;
    ```

1. 编写一个sql语句，查询参加比赛场次最多的选手，若参与比赛场次相同，选择用户编号player_id较小的选手，结果返回用户编号player_id和参与的比赛数量match_num。

    ```sql
    select player_id, count(*) as match_num from
    (
    select * from
    (
    select first_player as player_id, count(*) as match_num 
    from matches 
    group by(player_id)
    ) as A
    union all select * from 
    (
    select second_player as player_id, count(*) as match_num 
    from matches 
    group by(player_id)
    ) as B
    ) as C
    group by (player_id)
    order by match_num desc, player_id;
    # not right
    
    select A.player_id,A.match_num+B.match_num as match_num from
    (
    select first_player as player_id, count(*) as match_num 
    from matches 
    group by(player_id)
    ) as A,
    (
    select second_player as player_id, count(*) as match_num 
    from matches 
    group by(player_id)
    ) as B
    where A.player_id = B.player_id
    group by (player_id)
    order by match_num desc, player_id
    limit 1;
    ```

2. 编写一个sql语句，查找每组中的获胜者。每组的获胜者是在组内累积得分最高的选手。如果有得分相同的情况，则认为player_id 最小的选手获胜，结果返回组号group_id和选手编号player_id，以group_id升序排列。

    ```sql
    select FIN2.group_id , min(FIN3.player_id) as player_id
    from
      (
        select group_id, max(tatal_score) as max_score
        from 
          (

              (
                select first_player as player_id,sum(first_score) as score
